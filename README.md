    The name of our website is FoodOverflow.
    
Inspired by StackOverflow, FoodOverflow is a question and answer website for enthusiast food lovers.

<h2>Motivation</h2>

We thought of this idea because as students who are living abroad in a foreign country with different culture, food and even climate, we had times where we want to cook certain dishes that we used to eat in our home country but then it is hard for us to make it here in South Korea as the ingredients that are needed for the recipe are hard to find due to the difference in ingredients used in local dishes and difference in climate which is not suitable for certain herbs or plants to grow.<br><br>
Therefore, we would often ask our friend who majored in culinary arts, questions such as

    ‚ÄúI want to make butter chicken, but It‚Äôs hard to find curry leaves here. Can I substitute it with something else?‚Äù
and

    ‚ÄúCan I use dried pandan leaves instead of fresh ones to make Nona Manis (A Malaysian delicacy) cause they don‚Äôt sell fresh ones here?‚Äù.
